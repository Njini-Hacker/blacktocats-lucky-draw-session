# Blacktocats Lucky Draw Ruffle Python App

## Prompt Used 

Watch a basic Python app evolve into an engaging GitHub commenter raffle system. Weâ€™ll use the GitHub API to fetch issue commenters, implement a dynamic winner selection process with animations, and deploy the app on GitHub Pages. Discover how GitHub Copilot speeds up development by assisting with API integration, code management, and documentation. The talk will culminate in a live demo, where the app will award a Mona plushie to a lucky audience member. Join us to explore modern Python development techniques that create interactive and deployable applications.
